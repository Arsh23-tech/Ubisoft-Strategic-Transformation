## Overview
This strategic analysis examines Ubisoft's organizational transformation as the company pivots from traditional AAA publishing to a "Games as a Service" (GaaS) model built around autonomous "Creative Houses." The report applies the Dynamic Capability Framework (Sensing, Seizing, Transforming) to propose actionable strategies addressing the core challenges of modern game development: rising costs, extended timelines, and intense market competition.

## Business Context
Ubisoft operates over 45 studios with ~19,000 employees, managing billion-euro IPs such as Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. Despite record net bookings of €2.32B in FY2023-24, the company faces structural challenges:

* Development costs exceeding $200M per AAA title
* 5+ year development cycles limiting market responsiveness
* Player expectations shifting toward persistent, evolving game worlds

## Strategic Framework
The analysis leverages three interconnected strategic thrusts:

| **Transforming** | Organizational Renewal | Autonomous Creative Houses with end-to-end IP ownership |
